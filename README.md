Easy Choropleths
====

An experimental tool to let humans build choropleths (data-shaded maps) without any knowledge of Javascript or GIS.

The idea is flushed out in my `ideas` repo here:

https://github.com/daguar/ideas/issues/2

### Running

Right now, easiest way is to `cd` into the root directory and run the python one-liner web server:
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

Then load up your browser (preferably Chrome with Dev Console open) to:
